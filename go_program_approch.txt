-how to approach this project like OO program
-Go IS NOT object oriented language
-I can use extend of the base type like 'string' to give extra
functionality which act like class in oo programming
-Extend base type has it's own name but act just like base type 
-Syntex is 'type (name of extended type) (exist base type)'
-function associated with extended type is functions with receiver
which act like method inside instance of class
-program structure going to be 
    * main.go (which is already exist)
    * deck.go (code about deck and how it work)
    * deck_test.go (test file to automatically test the deck)
